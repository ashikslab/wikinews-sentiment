This is  simple set of programs for fetching the most recent headings from Wikipedia's
Latest news section and running a sentiment analyzer (from the Google cloud natural language API) on it.
Depending on the results, a text summary of the general feeling is printed.

This program is designed to be run as cron job with a fixed interval and write the results
to the google cloud storage.

A live demo of the program is available at http://www.ashikslab.in
